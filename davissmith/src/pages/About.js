      <p>
      Hi, I’m Davis, a recent graduate from UNC Chapel Hill with a degree in computer science. During my time at Chapel hill I’ve had the chance to learn many technologies and principles, everything from data structures to creating full web apps with tools like ExpressJS and ReactJS. My passion lies at the intersection of technology and product: how can I use the most cutting edge tools to create excellent, easy to use software. In addition to my technical background. I’ve had the opportunity to learn leadership and communication skills. As a part of the Fellows honor program at Samford University, I went through a rigorous two year program in great books. This experience helped to cultivate my written and verbal communication skills while I studied the great works of the western canon. In addition to my academic coursework, I've had hands-on leadership training as a sailing instructor and administrator.  Throughout my tenure I have taught everything from introductory sailing courses to advanced racing techniques to offshore passage planning. In these roles I have not only served as an instructor but also a supervisor for a staff of 50. This experience highlights my ability to be both a leader and a team player while organizing large staff’s and teaching complex topics. My cumulative experience highlights my greatest strength: my ability to communicate and understand technical concepts to a variety of audiences.
